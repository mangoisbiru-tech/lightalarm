# Product Context: Light Alarm App

## Why This Project Exists

### The Problem
Traditional alarm clocks are jarring and disruptive. They:
- Jolt people awake with sudden loud noises
- Create stress and anxiety around waking up
- Don't respect natural circadian rhythms
- Offer no help with falling asleep
- Provide a single-purpose solution (only wake-up)

### The Solution
Light Alarm App transforms the wake-up and sleep experience by:
- **Gradual light simulation** that mimics natural sunrise/sunset
- **Beautiful themed color progressions** that are calming and aesthetic
- **Dual-mode functionality** for both waking up and falling asleep
- **Comfort lighting** for all-night ambient illumination
- **Customizable sensory experience** (visual + audio)

## How It Should Work

### User Journey: Wake Mode

1. **Setup Phase**
   - User sets alarm time (e.g., 7:00 AM)
   - Selects a theme (e.g., "Sunrise")
   - Chooses pre-alarm duration (e.g., 10 minutes)
   - Selects alarm sound preference
   - Optionally sets repeat days

2. **Pre-Alarm Phase** (10 minutes before alarm)
   - Phone screen gradually brightens from black
   - Colors transition through theme palette (dark purple → pink → orange → yellow)
   - Brightness increases from 1% to max (50/70/100%)
   - Optional Nendo animations add subtle movement
   - Room gradually fills with colored light

3. **Alarm Phase** (at set alarm time)
   - Light reaches maximum brightness
   - Alarm sound plays (starts soft, gradually increases)
   - Haptic vibration pulses
   - User sees "Stop Light" and "Stop Alarm" buttons
   - Can stop light but let sound continue (or vice versa)
   - Snooze option available if enabled

4. **Wake Phase**
   - User is gently awakened by light and sound
   - Stops alarm with button tap
   - Returns to main UI

### User Journey: Sleep Mode

1. **Setup Phase**
   - User selects "Sleep" tab
   - Chooses sleep theme (e.g., "Sunrise" reversed)
   - Sets sleep duration (e.g., 30 minutes)
   - Optionally selects sleep audio (nature sounds, ambience)

2. **Sleep Phase**
   - User taps "Start Sleep"
   - Screen goes fullscreen with bright themed color
   - Colors gradually transition from bright to dark
   - Audio plays softly (if selected)
   - Brightness remains high for most of duration

3. **Final Dimming Phase** (last 2 minutes)
   - Brightness gradually dims from 100% to 1%
   - Colors reach darkest point (near black)
   - Audio fades out
   - User drifts to sleep in near darkness

4. **Exit**
   - Timer ends and screen turns off
   - Or user taps screen to exit early

### User Journey: Comfort Light

1. **Activation**
   - User enables "Comfort Light" toggle
   - Selects extremely dim brightness (default 5%)
   - Chooses deep red or amber color
   - Sets duration (e.g., "All Night" or specific hours)

2. **Night Light Phase**
   - Screen provides very dim ambient light
   - Optional dynamic brightness variation (candlelight effect)
   - No sudden changes - stays consistent
   - Battery-friendly illumination

3. **Exit**
   - Timer ends, or
   - User manually disables it

## User Experience Goals

### Visual
- **Beautiful:** Every screen should look polished and aesthetic
- **Calming:** Colors and animations should reduce stress
- **Natural:** Transitions should feel organic, not mechanical
- **Immersive:** Fullscreen modes should be distraction-free

### Functional
- **Reliable:** Alarms must work every time
- **Intuitive:** No manual needed - UI explains itself
- **Flexible:** Power users can customize extensively
- **Respectful:** App respects system settings and battery

### Emotional
- **Gentle:** Wake-ups should feel natural, not forced
- **Peaceful:** Sleep mode should ease users into rest
- **Delightful:** Small touches (animations, haptics) add joy
- **Trustworthy:** Users should feel confident setting their alarm
