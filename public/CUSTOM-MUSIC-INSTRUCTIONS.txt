ðŸŽµ HOW TO ADD YOUR CUSTOM ALARM MUSIC ðŸŽµ

To use your own music file as the alarm sound:

1. COPY your music file to this folder:
   C:\Users\lau_w\Desktop\light-alarm-app\public\

2. RENAME your music file to:
   alarm-music.mp3

   (or alarm-music.wav, alarm-music.m4a, etc.)

3. In the app settings, select "Custom Music File" as your alarm sound

4. REBUILD the app:
   cd C:\Users\lau_w\Desktop\light-alarm-app
   npm run build
   npx cap sync android

SUPPORTED FORMATS:
- MP3 (.mp3) - Best compatibility
- WAV (.wav) - High quality
- M4A (.m4a) - Good compression
- OGG (.ogg) - Web standard

TIPS:
- Keep file size under 10MB for best performance
- Use clear, upbeat music that will wake you up
- The music will loop automatically during the alarm
- The alarm stops when you tap "Stop Alarm"

If your custom file doesn't work, the app will automatically fallback to the built-in "Upbeat Tempo" alarm sound.
